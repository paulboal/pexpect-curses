About This Module
=================
The swearjar module provides headless terminal emulation and the ability to do expect() like programming against the screen buffer.

The module was originally created to automate data entry in curses-based screens.  The programs that use it are also included in this project as an example of how swearjar works.


Dependencies
============
Swearjar uses pexpect and GateOne's terminal module heavily to manage terminal interaction.  This module is a wrapper on top of those modules to provide a simpler scripting API.
